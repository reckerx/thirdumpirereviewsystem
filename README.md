This is a file using which we can take the decision about out and not-out. 
Here we are going to make the decision review system using python which will take an accurate decision about whether the batsman is out or not out.
Here, we watch a video or clip in slow motion and we can take decision.
Note:- While using this file, you can use another clip or video file(mp4).
